<h2>Data Structures an Algorithms in Python</h2>

I'm trying my hands on Python and I thought the best way to learn is to develop codes for fundamental and advanced data structures. So, here's my repository for my codes for the several exercises and programming projects in the Data Structures book   ["Data Structures and Algorithm by M.T. Goodrich et.al"](bit.ly/data_structures)

Check out the codes if you don't mind. Comments for improvements are welcome.

Each file is an iPython notebook (.ipynb) containing programming codes for each chapter in the book. It's best viewed with "Continuum Anaconda" python distribution or the "Enthought Canopy" distribution.


Chapters Exercises
==================

1. Python Primer - Whirlwind of Python (Objects, functions, iterators, generators, scope, etc)
2. Object-Oriented Python (Pattern, class, inheritance, testing and debugging, namespace, etc)
3.
